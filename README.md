# Utilities
Useful stuff made by me
1. make_unordered_map<TKey, TValue>(std::pair<TKey, TValue>...) - enhanced map initialization, using emplayce and requiring implicit convertion.
2. Events::Delegate<\_Ret_Type, Args...> is used to store and invoke functions and member-functions.
Events::Event is my event implementation in c++.
